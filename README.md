DobbyBot
========

DobbyBot is a texting bot with many commands.

Instructions
========

Mac
========

This is extremely useful to OS X Yosemite (OS X 10.10) because you can send SMS messages in Yosemite if you have an iPhone.

Using Messages
========

1. Open up the Preferences on the Messages app and go to the “General” tab, and under “AppleScript Handler” select “Open Scripts folder” and move “Messages Bot.applescript” and “Messages Bot” to that folder.  Now select “Messages Bot.applescript” for the AppleScript handler.
2. Open up “Messages Bot.applescript” in the “Mac” folder.
3. Replace every instance of “YourUserName” with your computer’s user name, or replace the whole path to the appropriate path to the file “Blocked People.txt” in the “Messages Bot” folder.
4. Replace every instance of “[[youremail]]” with the email you use for Messages. You may need to change the service.

How to use the Bot
========

Now you and your friends can do the following commands:

“/choose”- type “/choose “ and add a series of items separated by commas and the bot will choose one.
Math- type math and the Dobby bot solves it.

Texts- The Dobby bot will echo everything you and your friends say.

“/listblocked” or “/list blocked”- Show a list of all the people you’ve blocked.

“/quote” Entering “/quote text”, for example, will make the bot quote the words “text”. Basically, this makes it so the bot quotes you.

“/start tictactoe with” Enter someone’s full name (or email/phone number if they’re not a contact) after this, like “/star tictactoe with John Doe” to start a match of tictactoe with that person. There’s no win/tie system for this yet, so you’ll have to /endmatch.

“/endmatch” End a match of tictactoe.

Commands only you can use
========

“/block”- Block someone from using the DobbyBot by typing “/block “ and their name as it appears in your Contacts or (if you don’t have them in your contacts) their email.

“/unblock”- Unblock someone who was blocked from using the DobbyBot by typing “/unblock “ and their name as it appears in your Contacts or (if you don’t have them in your contacts) their email.

Any combination of the words “shut”, “up”, and “Dobby” (this last part is case-sensitive)- Type this to make the bot reply “Yes, master.”
